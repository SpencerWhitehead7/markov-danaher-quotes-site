# Markov Chain Based John Danaher instagram post generator

## What is this

This is a website that procedurally generates instagram posts in the style of John Danaher, based on a Markov chain generated from his social media posts. Who is that and why do this, you ask? Danaher is a (relatively) famous brazilian jiu jitsu coach, who makes lengthy and, let's say, distinctively, written social media posts. I'm a longtime social media follower of his with an interest in procedural generation, and I recently used his considerable corpus of work to make a program that procedurally generates Danaher-y quotes with a Markov chain. He doesn't have enough writing to make a chain that always produces truly stunning quotes (yet), but I thought it was cool enough to tun into a website for other people could check out.

## Future Plans

Maybe keep improving the match with a real Instagram tile and scrape some better, higher quality photos to go with the quotes instead of the not-amazing collection I have right now.

It might also be worth making a second fake Instagram tile layout that resembles how posts appear in the Instagram app that would show up for mobile viewers.

I'll need to change the fake Instagram post tile(s) every time Instagram changes them as well.

A way to mock up fake comments would also be amazing, but I'm not sure it's possible.
