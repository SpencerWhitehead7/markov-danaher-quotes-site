# Markov Chain Based John Danaher instagram post generator

## What is this

This is a website that procedurally generates instagram posts in the style of John Danaher based on a Markov chain of his social media posts. Who is that and why make a site for this, you ask? Danaher is a (relatively) famous brazilian jiu jitsu coach, especially known in the community for his lengthy and, let's say, distinctively, written social media posts. As a longtime follower of his, I recently used his considerable corpus of work to procedurally generate Danaher-y quotes with a Markov chain, and I thought it was worth turning into a website other people could check out. The original scripts are here: https://github.com/SpencerWhitehead7/markov-danaher-quotes

## Future Plans

I'd like to make the website nice and slick and perhaps style it (or maybe just the part that displays the quote) to resemble instagram. Also, it would be nice if it randomly selected some Danaher picture(s) to go with the quotes.
