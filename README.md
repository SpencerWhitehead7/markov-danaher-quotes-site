# Markov Chain Based John Danaher instagram post generator

## What is this

This is a website that procedurally generates instagram posts in the style of John Danaher, based on a Markov chain generated from his social media posts. Who is that and why do this, you ask? Danaher is a (relatively) famous brazilian jiu jitsu coach, who makes lengthy and, let's say, distinctively, written social media posts. I'm a longtime social media follower of his with an interest in procedural generation, and I recently used his considerable corpus of work to make a program that procedurally generates Danaher-y quotes with a Markov chain. He doesn't have enough writing to make a chain that always produces truly stunning quotes (yet), but I thought it was cool enough to tun into a website for other people could check out.

The original scripts are here: https://github.com/SpencerWhitehead7/markov-danaher-quotes

The deployed website is here: Coming soon!

## Future Plans

I'd like to make the website nice and slick and perhaps style it (or maybe just the part that displays the quote) to resemble instagram. Also, it would be nice if it randomly selected some Danaher picture(s) to go with the quotes.
